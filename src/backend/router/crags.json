Finnish Climbing Association has good co-operation with the park admistration and we like to keep it that way. Please act politely! Take your trash and all other trash with you! \n\nThe walk-in is shortest from the north parking. It takes about 30 minutes on good roads. There's a well near the climbing site where you get water for cooking. Sometimes the bacteria can be too high for drinking, though. If the trash bins on park entrances are full or locked take your trash with you back to civilization.\n\nDuring spring and summer many birds nest in Olhava. \n\n\n- Raven (korppi, Corvus corax) is known to nest between routes Puntari and Sammalr√§nni. If you see a raven nesting here or somewhere else, please climb other routes.\n\n- Kaakkuri (Gavia stellata) is known to have a nest in the middle of the Olhavanlampi pond on her own small little island.  If you're a bad sleeper, please use earplugs. Kaakkuri is sometimes giving loud sounds during the morning hours and she has every right to do so! This is her territory.\n\nThere's a climbers boat courtesy of Finnish Climbing Association. You may use it as long as you don't break it. If you need to climb beyond sector Laatta (ie. Stradarotta or Tulenarkaa sectors), please walk the path from above. On good summer days the boat has high demand for pendeling between the shore and the Laatta island.\n\n","route_count":103,"sport_count":5,"trad_n_p_count":90,"boulder_count":2,"dws_count":0,"likes_count":295,"grade4_count":21,"grade5_count":24,"grade6_count":40,"grade7_count":16,"grade8_count":2,"grade9_count":0,"topo_count":24,"must_hide_topos":null,"route_counts":{"Traditional":{"750":1,"600":6,"500":6,"380":13,"450":3,"400":5,"200":4,"275":7,"700":5,"300":5,"0":1,"950":1,"100":1,"550":1,"1000":1,"800":1},"Partially bolted":{"500":3,"600":5,"450":3,"700":4,"300":4,"400":4,"200":1,"750":2,"380":2,"650":1},"Sport":{"650":1,"950":1,"1050":1,"500":1,"700":1},"Boulder":{"200":1,"600":1},"Aid":{"0":6}},"created_at":"2008-06-18T19:27:07.000Z","updated_at":"2022-01-01T09:15:01.000Z","premium_topo_active":true,"photo":{"likes":{"likes":[{"id":1388,"climber_id":4792,"votable_id":8,"votable_type":"Photo","weight":1,"created_at":"2014-06-23T19:58:15.000Z","updated_at":"2014-06-23T19:58:15.000Z"}],"type":"Photo","id":8},"id":8,"album_id":1,"album_type":"Crag","photographer":"Anna Bengts","route_or_problem":"","caption":"From the other side of the lake","route_id":null,"vote_sum":1,"created_at":"2008-06-18T19:29:53.000Z","updated_at":"2014-06-23T19:58:18.000Z","styles":{"small":{"url":"https://27crags.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/000/000/8/small-67d647554c40.jpg","dimensions":[80,80]},"huge":{"url":"https://27crags.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/000/000/8/huge-4ffb27bba117.jpg","dimensions":[760,570]},"size_s":{"url":"https://27crags.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/000/000/8/size_s-67d647554c40.jpg","dimensions":[160,160]},"size_m":{"url":"https://27crags.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/000/000/8/size_m-47554c404ffb.jpg","dimensions":[382,236]},"size_l":{"url":"https://27crags.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/000/000/8/size_l-4c404ffb27bb.jpg","dimensions":[1120,840]}}},"location":{"id":3,"parent_id":2,"name":"Repoveden kansallispuisto","country_code":null,"category":"zone","latitude":61.1859,"longitude":26.8398,"zoom":10,"param_id":null,"area_size":null,"helper":null,"created_at":"2008-06-18T19:18:48.000Z","updated_at":"2022-01-01T09:15:01.000Z"}},{"id":2,"name":"Pe√±√≥n de Ifach","param_id":"penon-de-ifach","latitude":"38.634602","longitude":"0.075831","area":null,"zoom":null,"important":null,"main_sector_id":null,"country_id":98,"access_status":"green","access_info":"Acces via the signs ''penon de ifach'' natural park and enter via the path and walk up to reach the north face.

Turn right onto \"Alla Monda\" 1km after the switchbacks. Follow the road back north (one right turn), pass under the railway (close the fence for the hoses) and park under the big highway bridge. \nFor Altirolo: Drive even more south on road 2, only turn right and cross the river in Giornico.
